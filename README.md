# saveloc
A simple saveloc addon for gmod

It is very important that you edit the function 'PLAYER:CanLoadLoc()' at line 7 for this to work with our gamemode!

To use this is very simple. It all works with console commands.

To save a location you use the command `sm_saveloc`.  
To then load it you use `sm_loadloc`. You can optinaly specify a location like so: `sm_loadloc 4`.  
To go to the previous location you use `sm_prevloc`.  
To go to the next location you use `sm_nextloc`.  
To go to the latest location you use `sm_lastloc`.  
To go to the first locaiton you use `sm_firstloc`.  
To delete the current location you use `sm_delcurloc`.  
To delete all locations you use `sm_delallloc`.
